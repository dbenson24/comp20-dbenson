# Comp20-dbenson

## What is this purpose of this Git repository?
This Git Repository is the location of all my submissions for Comp 20 Fall 2015.

## What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite lab or assignment was Duckhunt,  it was my first experience using anything
like Canvas and I really enjoyed it.

## How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I think that I have grown much more confident in my abilities to read and understand
HTML/CSS/Javascript and have some experience now integrating outside API's into 
my own work.

## What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
The most important thing that I learned in this course is the concept of Request/Response.
Thinking about programs that only ever have 1 possible user is entirely different
from the logic required to write a webservice that can have thousands of users
connected at the same time. In my semester group project we needed to know a number
of things about the request that was being made, including which user was making the request.
It was challenging at first being able to make sure that all of the necessary data
was being sent with each request.

## Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I think now I would like to delve deeper into building much more responsive client-side
Javascript applications using a framework like React, and I would also like to experiment
with some other server-side languages like Go or Ruby.
